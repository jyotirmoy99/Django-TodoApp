    <h2>What is TodoList?</h2>
    <p>
        ToDoList is software in the category of Task Management, Project Management, Productivity, “Getting Things Done”
        (GTD), Scheduling, and Collaboration. We have a lot of choices to help us keep track of daily obligations. A
        simple
        list on paper of things “To Do” is enough for some people.
